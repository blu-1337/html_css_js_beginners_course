HHTP how we share the resources, a set of standardized rules

the request response circle

click on page > view source to see what the server sent the browser

Browser sends http request for us to the server which responds with http request

front end, back end - two separate locations but both very critical

server sends back HTML CSS JS code back

HTML CSS & JS are the only languages that your browser understands and utilizes for web pages

codepen calculator: https://codepen.io/giana/pen/GJMBEv
This uses all three technologies 
here you can remove the CSS and JS parts to see what it looks like without
add CSS back in, and comment that the JS functionality is not present


HTML is the what of the page, CSS describes that structure and makes it look good, JS is the verb/action and functionality of the web page


We now need to install our tools for development: https://www.google.com/chrome/
We also need VS Code
For macos it can be nice to have Spectacle (App) to rearrange your windows faster: https://www.spectacleapp.com/

To setup theme for VS Code: Settings>Workbench>Appearance
Extensions>install material theme
